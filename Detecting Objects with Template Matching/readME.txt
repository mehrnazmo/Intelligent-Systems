Detecting objects with template matching
*******************************************************************
In this project, we want to locate a specific template in an image; in other words, we want to search for a specific part of the image using convolution, cross correlation, and normalized cross correlation. 

The output is the image with a rectangle wrapped around the identified templated and also the heat map of the image indicating the probability of existing the template in a certain place.
