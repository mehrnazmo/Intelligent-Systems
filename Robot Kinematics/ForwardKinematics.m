%{
This function is supposed to implement forward kinematics for a robot arm
with 3 links constrained to move in 2-D. 

INPUTS:
l0, l1, l2 : Lengths of the robot links 
theta0, theta1, theta2 : Robot joint angles

OUTPUTS:
[x_1,y_1]: location of the first joint
[x_2,y_2]: location of the second joint
[x_e,y_e]: location of the end effector

Note: Remember the zeroth joint x_0, y_0 is always at the origin [0,0]
(See illustration in the question)

function [x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_e,y_e] = ForwardKinematics(l0,l1,l2, theta0, theta1, theta2)
x_1 = l0 * cos(theta0);
y_1 = l0 * sin(theta0);
x_2 = x_1 + l1 * cos(theta0+theta1);
y_2 = y_1 + l1 * sin(theta0+theta1);
x_e = x_2 + l2 * cos(theta0+theta1+theta2);
y_e = y_2 + l2 * sin(theta0+theta1+theta2);
