Robot Traversal
*******************************************************************
Traversal of a robot in an arbitrary floor using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. This is done by defining a mesh grid and potential over the floor. The floor plan can be changed. Objects that the robot should avoid are defined as repulsers. Attractors and different start/end points can also be defined.
